        <h2>How To Prepare For a Wig</h2>
          <p>If you think you might want to get a wig, it’s helpful to take some steps to prepare before you start chemotherapy or another treatment that may cause hair loss. For example:
            <ul>
              <li>Find or take a couple of pictures of your preferred hairstyle. This will make it easier to find a wig that’s closest to your color, length, and style if you decide that’s what you want.</li>
              <li>Cut your hair short. It's less traumatic to lose short clumps of hair than long ones, and it's easier to fit a wig over less hair. Also, if you get used to short hair, you won’t have to wait as long while your hair is growing back to feel like yourself.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Consider picking out a wig before you start a treatment that can cause hair loss. You’ll have more energy, and you can get used to wearing the wig in trial sessions, alternating with your own hair.</p>
        <h2>Covering the Cost of a Wig</h2>
          <p>Many health insurance companies cover part or all of the cost of the wig if your doctor writes a prescription. A wig is, after all, a remedy for a treatment side effect, just as important as medication you take to treat nausea. Here are the steps to take if you want to try to get your insurance to pay for your wig:
            <ul>
              <li>Before purchasing a wig, call your health insurance company and ask if they will cover a “cranial prosthesis” for hair loss related to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. If so, ask what is the maximum cost they will cover, what paperwork you will need to submit your claim (including details on what the prescription from your doctor needs to say), and how long it will take to get reimbursed.
              </li>
              <li>In most cases, you will have to pay for your wig upfront and then get reimbursed after you submit a claim to your insurance company. Typically, you’ll need to send your insurance company a prescription from your doctor for a “cranial prosthesis” or a “hair prosthesis” (with a cancer diagnosis code), the receipt for the wig (with the wig company’s tax ID number), and a completed insurance claim form. Some wig providers and hospital centers will handle the insurance claim for you and won’t require you to pay upfront.</li>
              <li>Keep a copy of your receipt if you end up paying for all or part of your wig out of pocket. It might be a medical expense that you can take as a tax deduction.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>If you don't have coverage or would prefer not to go through the process of filing an insurance claim, keep in mind that the American Cancer Society and a number of other organizations offer free or reduced cost wigs to people undergoing cancer treatment. You can find out about options for getting a free wig by searching online, contacting your local chapter of the American Cancer Society, or contacting the social workers at your local cancer center.</p>
        <h2>Choosing a Wig</h2>
          <p>Our Staff is carefully trained and dedicated to helping you select the right wig that is appropriate for your personal style and budget. Our skilled wig experts start by taking measurements of you head to determine an appropriate cap size. We will help you to decide if you’d like a wig that’s similar in color and style to your own hair, or if you want a different look. You may want to get two wigs: one that’s more like your current hair and one that’s a fun new length, color, and/or style.
            <ul>
              <li>Consider choosing a color that is somewhat lighter than your own hair. Your skin color may be off during chemotherapy — grayish, greenish, or yellowish. Less contrast is generally more flattering, and won’t call attention to your complexion.
              </li>
              <li>Determine if you want a wig that’s made out of a synthetic fiber, human hair, or a mixture of both. Most women choose synthetic wigs. They look and feel good, need very little attention and care, and are moderately priced ($149 to $500). A wig made of real human hair could cost between $800 and $3,000, or more, and it requires more care than you give your own hair. We recommend starting with synthetic for your first unit and for those experiencing temporary hair-loss. </li>
              <li>Go for the best-quality, most natural-looking wig you can afford. Key features that make a wig look realistic are a lace front and a monofilament part or top. In a lace front wig, each hair in the front of the wig is individually tied to a sheer material, creating the appearance of a natural hairline. Monofilament tops or parts make the top of the wig look realistic and are made by tying or sewing the hair in sections into the top portion of the cap, which is made from a fine, sheer material.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        <h2>Putting On Your Wig</h2>
          <p>Follow these steps to put on your wig and get a good fit:
            <ul>
              <li>If you have natural hair of any length, you’ll need to keep it as smooth and flat as possible by pinning it down and by wearing a nylon or mesh wig cap under your wig. Even if you don’t have hair, you should in most cases wear a wig cap because it will keep the wig secure, absorb sweat, and protect your scalp from irritation. Some women choose to wear a wig band instead of or in addition to a wig cap. A wig band is similar to a head band and it doesn’t adhere to the wig but helps to keep it in place.</li>
              <li>Adjust the velcro tabs located in the back of the wig to get the best fit.</li>
              <li>Tilt your head forward. Using both hands, put the front of the wig at your hairline and then pull the wig on using a front to back motion. Use the ear tabs (near your temples) to help center the wig.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        <h2>Caring For Your Wig</h2>
          <p>With proper care and storage, a synthetic wig should last for 3 to 5 months and a human hair wig should last 9 months to a year of daily wear. Here’s how to keep your wig looking good for as long as possible:
            <ul>
              <li>Wash and condition your wig after every 8 to 10 wears.</li>
              <li>Give your wig “time off” on occasion by using a turban, scarf, or hat.</li>
              <li>Give your wig “time off” on occasion by using a turban, scarf, or hat.</li>
              <li>When you’re not wearing your wig, store it on a wig stand in a part of your home that that gets as little sunlight, heat, moisture, and dust as possible.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
